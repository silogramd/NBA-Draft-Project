    "In this section, orient your readers to your project. You've already written some of these in previous deliverables. Based on your final analysis, revise your problem statement and write a concise introduction section. This section should touch upon the following points, but should be written in full paragraphs. Your writing should incorporate all of these points (and more if you like) in a coherent way. Remember that you are trying to convince your readers that this is an important problem to tackle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement\n",
    "* Describe the problem you would like to tackle. \n",
    "    We wanted to assess how accurate teams are at drafting amateur players and to determine the average value of a certain draft slot over the history of the NBA draft. To determine the average value of a specific draft pick, we will be using different classifying algorithms to attempt to predict what draft slot a player came from based on their career statistics. We can also evaluate the order in which players are drafted and whether that order typically correspondents with actual order of player value added to a team. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* What is the topic of your project?\n",
    "    The topic of our project is the NBA draft and team's ability to accurately assess player value of players coming into the draft. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* What do you want to learn about it?\n",
    "    We want to learn whether teams typically draft players in the order that corresponds with actual order of player value (from best to worst). \n",
    "    \n",
    "Significance of the Problem\n",
    "* Why is it important to tackle this problem in your project?\n",
    "    This would help a general manager or front office executive of a NBA team determine how valuable a specific draft pick or future draft pick they might recieve via trade is. Draft picks are often shuffled from one team to another in the NBA and are an important part of the trading landscape, but are difficult to quantify. Being able to use machine learning and data analysis to generate a rough estimate of the value of a draft pick would be very valuable to any NBA executives who want to make a trade. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* In what ways could the insights from this project be useful?\n",
    "    Again, insights from this project would be very influential on a team's ability to make effective trades for their franchise and get a fair value in any deal they make. The NBA is a multi-billion dollar industry, so trades can be extremely high stakes in relation to how much revenue a NBA franchise generates. Additionally, trades play a big role in which team emerges at the top of the league, which again affects revenue and the TV ratings of a team. \n",
    "    Additionally, if a team is consistently underperforming the expected values of their picks, it could help show that a specific general manager or front office struggles with drafting players. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Has there been previous work on your topic? Do some research into your topic. Cite your sources appropriately. You can use the numbered reference format or APA (if you are more comfortable with it).\n",

    "Questions/Hypothesis\n",

    "  Questions:\n",
    "    Does a player’s draft position correlate with their performance?\n",
    "        -How strong is the correlation?\n",
    "    Does a player’s first year / career stats indicate where they were drafted?\n",
    "  Hypotheses:\n",
    "    In general, players drafted earlier will outperform players drafted later.\n",
    "\tPlayers drafted adjacently will have similar performance.\n",
    "\t“Lottery” picks after 4 are not on average better than later first round picks.\n",
    "\tThe best player in the draft is usually a top pick. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Requirement:**\n",
